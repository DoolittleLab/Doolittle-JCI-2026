Aged murine bone marrow myeloid and mesenchymal cells develop unique senescence phenotypes

Description of the data and file structure

Code for re-analysis of the Tabula Muris Senis dataset and analysis of bulk RNA-seq data.

The single cell RNA-Seq data were analyzed from the publicly-available Tabula Muris dataset (36). 
Bulk RNA-seq raw data has been deposited under the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and is available from: 
-GSE294362 (non-skeletal tissues from LysM-LOX-ATTAC mice)
-GSE283633 (etoposide-treated BMSCs vs macrophages; freshly-isolated monocytes from young and old C57BL/6 mice)

Code/software: R v4.0.2
